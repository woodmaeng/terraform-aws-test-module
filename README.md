## Test Module

This is a test module I've created to experiment with. It's nothing fancy, just deploys a resource or two.
The aim is to test creating a module, publishing it, and then using an environment terraform configuration to deploy the module to various environments.

This module should know nothing about the specific environments, but should understand that it can be deployed to multiple environments and it needs to cater for that through variables.
